## Editorconfig
This project has a `.editorconfig` file in its root that must be abided by for consistency.  You can [download a plugin](http://editorconfig.org/#download) for nearly any text editor that will force your editor to use the rules set in the `.editorconfig` file.

## Node Dependencies
When adding, updating, or deleting Node dependencies, always make sure to [shrinkwrap](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/shrinkwrap) the dependencies.
